- **Design**: Suggest improvements to the architecture or API design
- **Community**: Help answer questions, review pull requests, or mentor new contributors

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- npm >= 8.0.0
- Git

### Installation

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/waspbot-ts.git
   cd waspbot-ts
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   npm run prepare
   ```

### Development Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes following the [coding standards](#coding-standards)

3. Run the development tools:

   ```bash
   # Type checking
   npm run typecheck

   # Linting
   npm run lint

   # Formatting
   npm run format

   # Build
   npm run build
   ```

4. Test your changes (see [Testing](#testing) section)

5. Commit your changes following the [commit guidelines](#commit-guidelines)

6. Push to your fork and create a pull request

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Enable strict type checking
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Avoid `any` type; use proper typing
- Use union types and generics where appropriate

### Code Style

- Follow the existing code style in the project
- Use Prettier for automatic code formatting
- Use ESLint for code quality
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

### File Organization

- Keep files small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Group related functionality in appropriate directories
- Export public APIs from `index.ts` files

### Error Handling

- Use proper error handling with try/catch blocks
- Throw descriptive error messages
- Use custom error classes for specific error types
- Handle async errors appropriately

## Testing

Testing is crucial for maintaining code quality. Currently, the project has placeholder test files that need implementation.

### Running Tests

```bash
npm run test
```

_Note: Test script needs to be added to `package.json`_

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for good test coverage

### Test Structure

- Place test files in the `tests/` directory
- Name test files with `.test.ts` extension
- Group related tests in `describe` blocks
- Use `it` or `test` for individual test cases

## Commit Guidelines

We follow conventional commit format for commit messages:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Types

- `feat`: New features
- `fix`: Bug fixes
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Examples

```

docs(readme): update installation instructions

test(strategies): add unit tests for arbitrage strategy
```

### Commit Best Practices

- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Use present tense ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Reference issue numbers when applicable
- Keep commits focused on a single change
- Squash related commits before merging

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Use a descriptive title following commit conventions
   - Provide a clear description of the changes
   - Reference any related issues

2. **Code Review**
   - Address review comments promptly
   - Make requested changes or explain why changes aren't needed
   - Ensure CI checks pass

3. **Testing**
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Test manually if applicable

4. **Merge**
   - Squash and merge approved PRs
   - Delete feature branches after merging
